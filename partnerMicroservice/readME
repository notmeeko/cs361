Microservice Read Me

Communication Contract:

A) To programmatically REQUEST the data, the user must input "access" to the lock.txt file.

   For example:
      with open("...lock.txt", "w") as file:
           file.write("access")

B) To programmatically RECIEVE the data, the program must read what's inside the lock.txt file
   as the program will replace "access" to the mood that the user inputs.

   Breif description:

      1. The main program initiates the process by requesting data, inputting "access" into the lock.txt file.
      2. The microservice reads the content of the lock.txt file.
      3. The microservice processes the data and returns the mood, replacing "access" in the lock.txt file.
      4. The user can then retrieve the mood from the lock.txt file.
