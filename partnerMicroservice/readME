Communication Contract:

To programmatically REQUEST the data, the user must input "access" to the lock.txt file.
For example:
   with open("...lock.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write("access")

To programmatically RECIEVE the data, the program must read what's inside the lock.txt file
as the program will replace "access" to the mood that the user inputs.
